We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/codeforeauclaire/codeforeauclaire.org/issues) to track bugs and features. We've included several of our open GitHub Issues right on our homepage using the [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues).


### Running the Site Locally on Your Computer

To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need Jekyll installed ([click here for Jekyll installation instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).)

Fork and clone the repository, then run the following command in the root directory of the repo:

`jekyll serve`

or

`jekyll serve --watch` which will watch for changes to files.

Your computer should now be serving your local copy of the site at:

[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
